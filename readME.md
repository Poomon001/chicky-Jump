# Chicky Jump Game
Chicky Jump Game is a PWA JavaScript Canvas game that supports PC, IOS and Android platforms developed from an online open-source code. It means to challenge players to jump up through a series of platforms and beat the highest score. 

Doodle Jump is one of my favorite games when I was in grade 10. This inspired me to make a Doodle Jump game in my version when I started learning to code.
